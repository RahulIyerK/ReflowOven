git pull : pulls content from server to your machine’s file system

git status : displays status of all files (unstaged (not added), staged (added), etc.)

git add filename : stages file named filename for commit (sets it up to be added)

git commit -m “message” : creates new commit to repository where staged (added) files are committed.  The commit message message shows up in the repo log.

git commit -a -m “message” : creates new commit with all unstaged files (adds all unstaged files first then commits all of them in a single commit…this isn’t recommended because you may be committing files that shouldn’t be on the server such as .DS_STORE files, etc.)

git push : pushes commit(s) to the repo
